        <p>Our data represents the top 100 brands in the world from this year - 2022- as well as the previous calendar year. Not only does the data include a ranking of these top 100 brands, but it also includes information about who founded them, the brand’s origin of country, the industry the brand falls under, and a bunch of other information that pertains to attributes of the brand. Our goal was to analyze this data and dissect what we can learn about where the top 100 brands come from and how they became so successful as to make this exclusive list.</p>
        <p>Our first question arose when we were looking at the correlation between the countries of origination and the number of brands from each country. We wanted to know which countries the majority of the top 100 brands in the world were coming from and how we could interpret that data. In order to do this we created a map visualization that scales circle elements according to the number of brands in each country. Our findings yielded that there were two countries that had over 75% of the top one-hundred brands which were the United States and China. Because the circles are scaled to represent the size of the number of brands, it is clear by the size of the circles in both China and the United States that they vastly overwhelm any of the other countries. We added values to the circles so that it is clear to readers that the size of the circles represents the specific number of brands in each country. Additionally, we found from the map that many countries in the world don’t even have one brand in the top 100 list, affirming to us that just a few countries really have control over the world economy. For the most part these are Western countries that are developed and have a history of both strong economy and government.</p>
        <p>When looking at the fact that two countries seem to control a big part of the economy – and have created over three-quarters of the world’s top brands– it is important to consider what industry these brands fall into. Without considering industry or genre of brand, perhaps we are missing the bigger picture – the simple reality could be that certain countries have a hold on industries that are just less profitable so they aren’t necessarily represented in the top 100. We decided to make a bar chart comparing the count of the top 100 countries to the genre/industry of the company. Our findings were that financial services, conglomerate, and retail industries had the largest representation in the top 100 brands. We used a color gradient to help show the different industries' count of brands. We noticed, similar to countries, that there were only seven industries that had more than two different brands represented. This was really interesting because it indicated to us that if countries focus their efforts more on the retail industry for example, they may have a higher likelihood of establishing a profitable and successful brand. We also noticed that many of the industries that only had one brand in the top 100 were very niche like food processing for example. We thought that one interesting thing to do given extra time with the data could be to do normalization on the data set so that we get an even better sense of the most successful industries – for example fashion might be the same as retail if we normalized the data. </p>
