          <p>Our data represents the top 100 brands in the world from this year - 2022- as well as the previous calendar year. Not only does the data include a ranking of these top 100 brands, but it also includes information about who founded them, the brand’s origin of country, the industry the brand falls under, and a bunch of other information that pertains to attributes of the brand. Our goal was to analyze this data and dissect what we can learn about where the top 100 brands come from and how they became so successful as to make this exclusive list.</p>
          <p>Our first question arose when we were looking at the correlation between the countries of origination and the number of brands from each country. We wanted to know which countries the majority of the top 100 brands in the world were coming from and how we could interpret that data. In order to do this we created a map visualization that scales circle elements according to the number of brands in each country. Our findings yielded that there were two countries that had over 75% of the top one-hundred brands which were the United States and China. Because the circles are scaled to represent the size of the number of brands, it is clear by the size of the circles in both China and the United States that they vastly overwhelm any of the other countries. We added values to the circles so that it is clear to readers that the size of the circles represents the specific number of brands in each country. Additionally, we found from the map that many countries in the world don’t even have one brand in the top 100 list, affirming to us that just a few countries really have control over the world economy. For the most part these are Western countries that are developed and have a history of both strong economy and government.</p>
          <p>When looking at the fact that two countries seem to control a big part of the economy – and have created over three-quarters of the world’s top brands– it is important to consider what industry these brands fall into. Without considering industry or genre of brand, perhaps we are missing the bigger picture – the simple reality could be that certain countries have a hold on industries that are just less profitable so they aren’t necessarily represented in the top 100. We decided to make a bar chart comparing the count of the top 100 countries to the genre/industry of the company. Our findings were that financial services, conglomerate, and retail industries had the largest representation in the top 100 brands. We used a color gradient to help show the different industries' count of brands. We noticed, similar to countries, that there were only seven industries that had more than two different brands represented. This was really interesting because it indicated to us that if countries focus their efforts more on the retail industry for example, they may have a higher likelihood of establishing a profitable and successful brand. We also noticed that many of the industries that only had one brand in the top 100 were very niche like food processing for example. We thought that one interesting thing to do given extra time with the data could be to do normalization on the data set so that we get an even better sense of the most successful industries – for example fashion might be the same as retail if we normalized the data. </p>

          <p>After looking at the dataset from Kaggle, we were able to draw connections between brand value and countries. First, we were able to aggregate the brand values of each country and display them as a bar chart. This allows us to take a closer look at the countries with the most brand value. The result of the chart is interesting in descending order. The red lines show brand values in 2022 and the fading gray lines show brand values in 2021. We have the United States coming off as the country with the most brands that are performing above average. The United States companies were very well off in the last fiscal year, with a 21.63% increase in aggregated brand value. China holds the second highest in the spectrum. It increased by about 6% in aggregated brand value. And lastly, Taiwan holds the last place.</p>
          <p>Next, we are interested in examining the specific brand that are doing exceptionally well in the last year. For this visualization, we decided to focus on using packed bubble illustrations. This geospatial illustration allows the audience to quickly process which bubbles are the biggest and which are the smallest bubbles. It allows the audience to quickly search and access information without the need to scroll down to find the largest or the smallest entry. This visualization comes with a tooltip that allows the readers to hover over the bubble, and it will show the necessary information that the audience need to know. For example, the bubble illustration allows audiences to quickly capture the largest bubble at the lower right hand corner. This bubble represents TikTok, one of the largest and rapidly growing video streaming services. It makes sense that TikTok occupies the largest circle. However, it is not just TikTok. Other companies are also operating very well. These companies include Allianz Group, TSMC, Google Louis Vuitton, Target, YouTube, Apple, Accenture, Tesla and etc. This visualization shows the firms that have a positive brand value change.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, both visualizations are insightful. They are enlightening in the sense that they allow the readers to quickly understand and grasp information that could have taken hours if they sit down to go over the data set or do research on the company’s financial strength. The colors of the visualizations are set so that they have a vibrant color which helps the audience to focus and engage in the visualization. Lastly, it is safe to infer that the technology companies are at stable growth. And companies from underdeveloped regions of the world, such as Taiwan, enjoyed rapid growth in brand value (TSMC).</p>

        <div class="TextWrap">
          <p>A brand might be more powerful because it has a rich history, so this part of the story goes back to the time when those brands were founded. With history, the most common thing people think about is the timing, so we first created a scatter plot about the rank and the year founded. Before diving to the visualization and the actual correlation, people usually assume the longer history the brand has, the better reputation and agility to adapt, and the rank will go up. </p>
          <p>Then, we created the scatterplot visualization, and Sumitomo Group is an outlier. However, the crowd on the right has more density in the bottom right corner than the top left corner. We could infer that year founded and ranking have a negative correlation. After adding a trendline, we found that the correlation is significant, and the correlation is opposite of what most people would imagine. After we excluded Sumitomo Group, the picture was clearer. The negative correlation is still significant. The trendline is flatter, because Sumitomo Group was founded early but with a relatively low rank.</p>
          <p>Another important historical factor was how many key parts founded the company such as companies merging and people founding. For example, Apple was only founded by Steve Jobs, so the part number is 1. Different founding parts indicate how diverse the ideas are, but there are more obstacles working with different parts since they have disagreements that are hard to coordinate. Since the start of the company is a critical time to form company culture, the early harmony and conflict are determinant for the company’s fate in the future. Therefore, we are not sure about how the number of founding partners will affect the rank. </p>
          <p>For this case, we created a visualization breaking down each number of founding partners and seeing how the rank distribution looks like. From the visualization, we did not find out if any number of founding partners have all circles congregating at one rank. Instead, they are all evenly distributed across ranks, so there might not be a correlation between the number of people/companies founding and the rank.</p>
          <p>However, we want to recognize a limitation here that even if they have the same number of founding partners, the influence can be different. Going back to the Apple example, we realized some brands are subsidiaries of another company. One person starting a brand from scratch like Apple is different from a brand with one powerful company standing behind a brand, even though we all count them as one founding partner.</p>
          <p>In addition, we felt like the visualization was a bit mundane, so we added color as countries, and we had some new findings. We realized that with more founding partners, there are more US companies, and they have been through more mergers and acquisitions than companies in other parts of the world. On the other hand, many high ranking companies with only one founding partner are Chinese. When we were cleaning the data, we found out that Chinese companies emerged from the state, which reflects the market structure of China that the government is a huge participant in the economy with a lot of power.</p>
